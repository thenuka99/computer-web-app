                <p>It was 1998. Who would have thought that one manâ€™s idea of creating a small website as a venue to share his writing about photography would turn into one of the most respected and largest sites on the internet for the photography enthusiast?
                    A lot of success in Life has to do with being in the right place at the right time. Michael Reichmann had a knack for being right there.</p>
                <p>The timing could not have been better. In 1998 Michael was at a crossroads in his Life. He had just completed the sale of his telecommunication business and was looking for something new to explore. Something that would allow him to return
                    to his first passion; photography. His enduring curiosity kept him learning about new things that captured his interest, especially when they related to photography, astronomy, emerging technology & science.</p>
